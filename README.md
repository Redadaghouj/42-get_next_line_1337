## üìú Project Overview  

**Get Next Line** is a foundational project at **1337** (part of the 42 Network). It challenges students to implement a function that reads and returns a line from a file descriptor, ensuring efficient memory usage and support for multiple file descriptors. This project is divided into a mandatory part and a bonus part.  

---

## üöÄ Features  

### Mandatory Part  
- Reads from a file descriptor line by line.  
- Handles customizable buffer sizes.  
- Manages memory efficiently to prevent leaks.  

### Bonus Part  
- Supports multiple file descriptors simultaneously.  
- Adds robustness for additional edge cases.

## üìÇ Repository Structure  

```plaintext  
|-- get_next_line.c                 // Core function implementation  
|-- get_next_line.h                 // Header file  
|-- get_next_line_utils.c           // Helper functions  
|-- get_next_line_bonus.c           // Bonus implementation for multiple file descriptors  
|-- get_next_line_bonus.h           // Bonus header file  
|-- get_next_line_utils_bonus.c     // Helper functions for the bonus part  
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/Redadaghouj/42-Get_next_line_1337.git  
cd Get_next_line_1337  
```  

### 2. Integrate into Your Project  

- For the **mandatory part**, use:  
  - `get_next_line.c`  
  - `get_next_line.h`  
  - `get_next_line_utils.c`  

- For the **bonus part**, use:  
  - `get_next_line_bonus.c`  
  - `get_next_line_bonus.h`  
  - `get_next_line_utils_bonus.c`  

### 3. Compile and Run  

The `BUFFER_SIZE` must be defined during compilation using the `-D BUFFER_SIZE=<value>` flag.  

#### Mandatory Part Compilation  
```bash  
gcc -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 your_main_file.c get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c -o your_program  
```  

#### Bonus Part Compilation  
```bash  
gcc -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 your_main_file.c get_next_line_bonus.c get_next_line_utils_bonus.c -o your_program  
```  

Replace `42` with your desired buffer size.

## üìñ Usage Example  

Here‚Äôs a usage example for both the mandatory and bonus parts:  

### Mandatory Example  
```c  
#include "get_next_line.h"  
#include <fcntl.h>  
#include <stdio.h>  

int main(void) {  
    int fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);  
    char *line;  

    while ((line = get_next_line(fd))) {  
        printf("%s", line);  
        free(line);  
    }  
    close(fd);  
    return (0);  
}  
```  

### Bonus Example  
```c  
#include "get_next_line_bonus.h"  
#include <fcntl.h>  
#include <stdio.h>  

int main(void) {  
    int fd1 = open("file1.txt", O_RDONLY);  
    int fd2 = open("file2.txt", O_RDONLY);  
    char *line;  

    while ((line = get_next_line(fd1))) {  
        printf("File1: %s", line);  
        free(line);  
    }  

    while ((line = get_next_line(fd2))) {  
        printf("File2: %s", line);  
        free(line);  
    }  

    close(fd1);  
    close(fd2);  
    return (0);  
}  
```

## üìã Objectives  

### Mandatory  
- Efficiently read from a file descriptor, one line at a time.  
- Understand memory management in dynamic allocations.  

### Bonus  
- Extend functionality to support multiple file descriptors simultaneously.  
- Test for additional edge cases.

## üåü Achievements  

- Successfully implemented both the mandatory and bonus parts of the **Get Next Line** project.  
- Gained a deeper understanding of system calls and file I/O in C.
